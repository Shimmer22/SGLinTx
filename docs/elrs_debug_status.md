# ELRS TX Debug Status

## Current Status

- Current working UART baudrate for the TX module is `115200`.
- ELRS `bind` is confirmed working on current hardware.
- ELRS `WiFi enable` path is now root-caused and fixed in protocol/runtime logic.
- ELRS `WiFi on` on this module is reliable only when the command is retried continuously while the module remains in CRSF mode.
- ELRS `WiFi off` in UI is still a **local/runtime clear only**; there is no CRSF-side disable command in ELRS 3.x.
- Current runtime exit strategy after `WiFi off` is:
  - clear local WiFi pending/retry state immediately
  - keep UART transmit path silent for a short cooldown
  - resume mixer / CRSF traffic only after that cooldown
- Remaining behavior is consistent with ELRS 3.x design:
  - entering WiFi is a parameter command
  - exiting WiFi is not a CRSF command path (module typically needs restart/reconnect path)

## Verified Environment and Evidence

From runtime logs:

- Device info frame received:
  - module name: `DuplicateTX ESP`
  - ELRS signature: `ELRS`
  - version bytes: `3.2.1`
  - **param_count = `0x13` (19)**

Representative device info frame:

```text
[EA, 1E, 29, EA, EE, 44, 75, 70, 6C, 65, 54, 58, 20, 45, 53, 50, 00, 45, 4C, 52, 53, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 03, 02, 01, 13, 00, D8]
```

Decoded key points:

- name = `DupleTX ESP` (module string in frame)
- serial marker = `ELRS`
- version = `3.2.1`
- **field count = 19**

This confirms UART + CRSF parameter transport is functional and module parameter protocol is active.

## What Was Wrong (WiFi Path)

### 1) WiFi “loading forever” symptom

Observed behavior:

- UI command:
  - `Activate -> WiFi params loading, please wait`
- Stays in this state too long / repeatedly without actually entering WiFi.

### 2) Log evidence that exposed the root cause

During settings enumeration:

```text
param entry field=0x0F chunks_rem=1 kind=0x0D label="Enable W" [parsed]
```

And similarly many entries were chunked (`chunks_rem > 0`), including WiFi-related fields.

Key evidence:

- `field=0x0F kind=0x0D` is a **COMMAND** field and is clearly the WiFi command (`Enable WiFi`) but label appears truncated (`Enable W`) in first chunk.
- `field=0x11 kind=0x0D label="Bind"` appears complete and works immediately, matching successful bind path.
- WiFi failed while bind succeeded under same transport, pointing to label/parse matching issue rather than UART issue.

---

## Root Causes (Final)

### Root Cause A — device param scan limit wrong

- Implementation previously used fixed max (`64`) for parameter reads.
- Actual module reported `param_count=19`.
- Over-scanning created unnecessary read traffic and delayed usable state.

### Root Cause B — chunked parameter labels were not handled robustly for WiFi discovery

- ELRS parameter entries can arrive in chunks (8-byte payload chunks).
- WiFi command label may appear as truncated first-chunk text (`"Enable W"`), with remaining text in next chunk.
- Exact-string WiFi lookup (`"Enable WiFi"`, `"Enter WiFi"`, `"WiFi Update"`) could miss truncated labels.

### Root Cause C — fallback matching too strict

- Fallback matching based only on `contains("wifi")` fails on truncated first chunk (`"Enable W"` does not contain `"wifi"`).

### Root Cause D — treating WiFi command as one-shot was insufficient on this TX module

- Although `field=0x0F` was the correct WiFi command field, a single `PARAM_WRITE 0x2D ... 0F 01` did not keep this module in WiFi mode reliably.
- Empirical board behavior showed the module only entered/stayed in WiFi when the same `START` command was retried continuously.

### Root Cause E — strict “wait for full multi-chunk assembly” regressed real hardware behavior

- The first `COMMAND` chunk (`"Enable W"`) already exposes the correct `field_id=0x0F`.
- Requiring the final chunk before exposing WiFi as executable caused repeated `WiFi params loading, please wait` on this module.
- For this module, first-chunk fallback is required for responsiveness; full assembly remains useful for later status/info updates.

## Fixes Applied

## 1. Use actual `param_count` from device info

`parse_device_info` now extracts field count from frame (`name_end + 12`) and stores it in `DeviceInfo.field_count`.

Effect:

- Enumeration stops at module-reported count (`19` for this module), not fixed `64`.
- Faster and less noisy parameter discovery.

## 2. Parameter scan upper bound now dynamic

`poll_outgoing_frame` uses:

- `scan_limit = device_info.field_count` (fallback to default max only if unknown).

Effect:

- predictable scan completion
- shorter delay before commands become actionable

## 3. COMMAND entries tolerate truncated first chunk labels

For `PARAM_SETTINGS_ENTRY (0x2B)` parsing:

- non-COMMAND types still require complete chunk semantics
- COMMAND type now allows first chunk parsing even when label terminator is missing in current frame, capturing truncated label safely

Effect:

- COMMAND fields are registered earlier (including WiFi command candidates)
- avoids dropping actionable command entries due to chunk boundary

## 4. WiFi command lookup now has robust fallback

After exact label matching fails, fallback now supports:

- case-insensitive `contains("wifi")`
- **prefix-based matching against known full labels**, so truncated labels like `"Enable W"` can map to `"Enable WiFi"`

Effect:

- WiFi command field (`0x0F`) is discoverable on chunked-label modules

## 5. Multi-chunk parameter assembly now coexists with first-chunk WiFi fallback

- parameter chunks are now assembled by `field_id` so later chunks do not corrupt earlier command discovery
- fully assembled entries are still parsed and stored once `chunks_rem=0`
- WiFi specifically is allowed to use the first `COMMAND` chunk as an executable fallback candidate when it already exposes the right field identity (`Enable W` -> `0x0F`)

Effect:

- avoids the earlier regression where WiFi stayed in `params loading`
- preserves more correct full-entry parsing for command status/info

## 6. COMMAND status parsing now matches EdgeTX/OpenTX CRSF expectations

`COMMAND` entries are now parsed as:

- `step`
- `timeout`
- `info`

Instead of treating trailing bytes as a plain status string.

Supported command steps now include:

- `READY`
- `START`
- `PROGRESS`
- `CONFIRMATION_NEEDED`
- `CONFIRM`
- `CANCEL`
- `POLL`

Effect:

- runtime logs now show actual command-step bytes for ELRS commands
- protocol can react to `POLL` / `CONFIRMATION_NEEDED` consistently

## 7. WiFi `START` command is now retried continuously while pending

Runtime behavior now:

- when WiFi is requested and `field=0x0F` is known, runtime sends
  - `C8 06 2D EE EF 0F 01 <crc>`
- if the module has not yet reported command completion/cancel, runtime retries the same `START` command on a timer

Effect observed on hardware:

- this specific TX module reliably enters WiFi only under repeated `START`
- one-shot send was not sufficient even though the field id was correct

## 8. WiFi off now clears both pending state and queued retries

- UI `WiFi off` still does **not** send a CRSF-side disable command
- but runtime now clears:
  - local `wifi_manual_on`
  - pending WiFi command state
  - already queued retry frames for `field=0x0F`
- runtime also suppresses all outbound UART traffic for a short exit cooldown before RC/mixer frames resume

Effect:

- switching WiFi from `ON` to `OFF` in UI stops further repeated `0x0F 01` transmissions immediately
- mixer output no longer resumes in the same moment as local WiFi clear; there is now a deliberate silent gap first
- RF output disable / module reconnect still remain the hard reset path that returns the module to normal ELRS operation

## 9. Continuous WiFi enable no longer floods logs

- repeated WiFi `START` retries are still sent while the command is pending
- runtime log now prints the WiFi `START` send only on the leading edge of a continuous enable session

Effect:

- keeping WiFi enabled no longer appends the same retry line continuously to `rf_link_service.log`

## 10. Runtime state improvements already aligned

- WiFi enable sets local state only when command is actually queued.
- WiFi mode active path suppresses RC frame streaming to avoid unnecessary serial traffic while module is in WiFi behavior.
- RF disable / module reconnect paths clear stale local WiFi state.

## Why Bind Worked While WiFi Failed

Bind field log:

```text
field=0x11 kind=0x0D label="Bind"
```

- label is short and complete in one chunk
- exact match succeeds
- command frame sent:

```text
[C8, 06, 2D, EE, EF, 11, 01, A5]
```

WiFi field log:

```text
field=0x0F kind=0x0D label="Enable W"
```

- label truncated in first chunk
- exact match failed before fix
- fallback also failed before prefix support
- therefore UI stayed in “params loading”/unavailable state

---

## Representative Correct Frames

Extended parameter addressing for ELRS TX module remains:

- destination/device: `0xEE`
- handset/source: `0xEF`

Examples:

- Read:
  - `C8 06 2C EE EF <field_id> <chunk> <crc>`
- Command/Write:
  - `C8 06 2D EE EF <field_id> 01 <crc>`

Bind command verified with:

```text
[C8, 06, 2D, EE, EF, 11, 01, A5]
```

WiFi command used on this module:

```text
[C8, 06, 2D, EE, EF, 0F, 01, 77]
```

Important practical note:

- on this TX module, **continuous retry of the above WiFi `START` frame** was required to make WiFi entry reliable

## Files Changed (This Debug Round)

- `src/elrs/mod.rs`
- `src/elrs_tx.rs`
- `examples/elrs_magic.lua`
- `docs/elrs_debug_status.md`

---

## Validation

Targeted tests:

```text
cargo test elrs:: -- --nocapture
```

Result after fixes:

- ELRS test set passes
- bind flow still good
- WiFi command discovery path is no longer blocked by chunked-label edge case
- WiFi first-chunk fallback and full multi-chunk assembly now coexist
- COMMAND status parsing is aligned with `step/timeout/info`
- WiFi `START` retry behavior is covered by unit tests
- WiFi `OFF` clears queued retry frames
- logs now provide clearer `field/chunk/kind/label/step/timeout/info` visibility for future debugging

---

## Final Conclusion

WiFi “卡住” was not caused by mixer RC output conflict as primary root cause.  
Primary issues were:

- **parameter discovery robustness** under chunked ELRS `0x2B` entries
- incorrect assumptions about when WiFi command discovery must wait for full assembly
- incorrect assumptions that a single WiFi `START` frame was enough on this hardware

After applying:

- real `param_count` scan limit
- COMMAND chunk-tolerant parsing
- WiFi prefix fallback matching
- proper COMMAND `step/timeout/info` parsing
- WiFi first-chunk executable fallback
- continuous WiFi `START` retry while pending
- WiFi off queue cleanup

the WiFi command path is aligned with the actual behavior of this ELRS 3.2.1 module:

- WiFi entry uses `field=0x0F`
- first chunk may be only `Enable W`
- command completion is stateful
- practical hardware behavior requires repeated `START` until the module fully leaves CRSF mode
